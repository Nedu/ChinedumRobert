# Nedu Robert

#### [nedu.github.io] (nedu.github.io)

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. My contact information can be found at the contact section of my website.

#### About Myself

I am a full stack developer with a wide range of skills that includes web design, front-end development, back-end development, linux, mac and windows server system administration, deployment and performance tuning. 

#### My Recent Projects

I am most familiar working with Python, PHP and mongoDB in the back end, and HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and AngularJS in the front end. Some other frameworks and libraries that I use include Bootstrap, MeteorJS, Flask and jQuery. I also use Github for version control, Heroku for app deployment in a cloud platform, and stylesheet preprocessors such as Sass and LESS. I'm currently working on a personal project where I am creating 100 websites in 100 days as a way to showcase my skills and abilities. 

#### What I'm looking for

I have a strong desire to grow as a developer and I want to work for a company that embraces learning. While I would be most comfortable to work at a place which employs the technologies I am familiar with, I am a fast learner and can easily pick up languages and frameworks quickly and would be happy to acquire new skills and knowledge. I am interested in full-stack positions, particularly when they deal with things like big data, data visualization, and data science.
